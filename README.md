Local 2D Fighter game

my first html canvas project, made in 1 week

there is some slight hitbox issues and there is a bug on macOS which makes the game play in slowmotion

Note: player ones attack animation is 2x slower than player 2 because of the animation frames, 
so as a balancing measure player1 can control his gravity down and p
layer2 cant.
