# 2D Canvas Fighter
this is my first project using html canvas it is not perfect at all.

Player1 Controls: W+A+S+D+*SPACE/ATTACK*
Player2 Controls: ARROWUP/ARROWLEFT/*ARROWDOWN/ATTACK*/ARROWRIGHT

Note: player ones attack animation is 2x slower than player 2 because of the animation frames, 
so as a balancing measure player1 can control his gravity down and player2 cant.
